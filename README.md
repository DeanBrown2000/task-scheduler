# Task Scheduler

A minimalist, web-based task scheduling app concept inspired by Raycast aesthetics. The dashboard consolidates task management workflows into a single experience with three complementary views: task list, Kanban board, and daily horizontal timeline.

## Planned Experience
- **Tabbed dashboard:** Quickly toggle between list, Kanban, and timeline views without leaving the main screen.
- **Quick add pop-out:** Create tasks from anywhere with a lightweight composer.
- **Rich task details:** Track assignee, date, title, description, priority, notes, and status in every view.
- **Drag-and-drop timeline:** Reschedule work by dragging tasks across the horizontal timeline.
