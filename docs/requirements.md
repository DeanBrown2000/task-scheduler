# Task Scheduler Requirements

## Product Vision
Create a minimalist web-based task scheduling application that keeps knowledge workers focused on their daily priorities. The interface should feel calm and lightweight like Raycast, while still surfacing the most important details about upcoming work.

## Primary Personas
- **Individual contributor**: Needs a lightweight way to manage personal work commitments, plan their day, and coordinate with teammates.
- **Team lead**: Oversees a small group, assigns work, and monitors progress across multiple streams.

## Core User Flows
1. Review today's workload from a single dashboard landing page.
2. Switch between task list, Kanban, and daily timeline views without leaving the dashboard.
3. Add a new task from anywhere using a quick-access pop-out menu.
4. Update task fields (assignee, priority, notes, etc.) in place.
5. Drag and drop tasks on the timeline to reschedule them to a new time block or day.

## Functional Requirements

### Dashboard Shell
- Launches to a full-width dashboard with a minimalist aesthetic using rich blues and reds, subtle gradients, and minimalist iconography reminiscent of Raycast.
- Provides top-level navigation (logo/title, search, user avatar) and retains space for future modules (notifications, filters).
- Persists active tab selection when users return to the dashboard during a session.

### Tabbed Workspace
- Three primary tabs aligned horizontally near the top of the dashboard:
  1. **Task List**: Table-like list with sortable columns (priority, due date, assignee, status) and inline quick actions for marking complete.
  2. **Kanban Board**: Column-based board representing workflow stages (Backlog, In Progress, Blocked, Done). Supports drag-and-drop between columns and shows task count per column.
  3. **Daily Timeline**: Horizontal timeline that displays tasks scheduled for the current day in chronological blocks. Supports zoom levels for workday vs. hourly detail.
- The tab bar highlights the active tab and uses icon + label pairings for quick recognition.

### Quick Add Task Menu
- Floating action button or keyboard shortcut opens a pop-out composer anchored to the dashboard.
- Pop-out remains accessible from every tab without shifting context.
- Composer contains fields for all mandatory data (title, date) and optional data (assignee, description, priority, notes).
- Submitting the form creates the task, closes the pop-out, and triggers a subtle confirmation toast.

### Task Model & Fields
Every task record includes:
- **Title** (required, short text)
- **Description** (multi-line rich text)
- **Assignee** (user lookup with avatar chips)
- **Due date / scheduled date** (calendar picker supporting all-day or time-specific slots)
- **Priority** (e.g., Critical, High, Normal, Low) with color-coded badges
- **Status** (Backlog, In Progress, Blocked, Done)
- **Notes** (free-form text or checklist entries)
- **Created/updated timestamps** (system generated)

### Task Interactions
- Inline editing of title, description, priority, assignee, and notes within each view.
- Mark complete toggle available on list and Kanban cards.
- Hovering a task reveals quick actions (edit, duplicate, delete).
- Notes field supports quick bullet creation and markdown-style formatting for clarity.

### Daily Timeline Drag-and-Drop
- Tasks render as horizontal blocks sized according to scheduled duration.
- Users can drag blocks horizontally to new time slots or vertically to different rows (assignees or categories).
- Dragging updates the scheduled date/time immediately and propagates the change to other views.
- Supports snap-to-grid (15-minute increments) and prevents overlaps unless explicitly allowed.
- Timeline includes "Today" marker, current time indicator, and zoom controls.

### Kanban Board Details
- Columns are customizable per team but default to Backlog, In Progress, Blocked, Done.
- Dropping a card into a column updates the task status.
- Each card shows title, assignee avatar, priority badge, due date chip, and note indicator.

### Task List Details
- Default sort by due date ascending, with secondary sort by priority.
- Inline filters for assignee, priority, status, and date range.
- Row selection enables bulk actions (reassign, change priority, move date, delete).

### Notifications & Feedback
- Confirmation toasts for create/update/delete actions.
- Error handling messages appear inline near the affected form control.
- Optional reminders for upcoming tasks (future enhancement).

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Responsiveness**: Layout adapts from desktop to tablet; timeline view degrades to stacked cards on narrow screens.
- **Accessibility**: Keyboard navigation for tab switching, quick add, drag-and-drop alternatives (e.g., keyboard adjustments), and WCAG AA color contrast.
- **Performance**: Target <200ms response for list updates; timeline drag should remain at 60fps on modern hardware.
- **Internationalization**: Support localized date/time formats and translations.

## Data & Integration Considerations
- Persist tasks in a backend service with REST or GraphQL endpoints (specific implementation TBD).
- Provide real-time sync via WebSockets or polling for multi-user scenarios (future milestone).

## Analytics & Metrics
- Track tab usage, task creation rate, and completion cadence to inform future improvements.

## Open Questions
- Authentication and user management approach.
- Team collaboration scope (shared boards vs. personal workspace).
- Reminder notifications delivery method (email, push, in-app).
